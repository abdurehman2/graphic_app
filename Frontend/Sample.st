	Compare 
		/base and
		/base/Chapters/Chapter1/FileContainingAReferenceToFigures.md
	When resolving figures/myPng referenced from within FileContainingAReferenceToFigures.md 
	we should get /base/Chapters/Chapter1/figures/myPng!
	Using base we lose Chapters/Chapter1 and only get /base/figures/myPng.
